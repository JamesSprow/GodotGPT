# This script extends the GPTRequest class, defining functionality specific to handling chat requests with GPT.
extends GPTRequest
# Assign a custom class name "GPTChatRequest" for easier reference and instantiation in other scripts.
class_name GPTChatRequest
## This class provides an interface to have a conversation with ChatGPT and use functions in a chat environment.

## Text to feed ChatGPT as its seed. For example "You are a helpful assistant trying to help the user make a Godot game" or "You are a chatbot that can only say 'Bark'"
@export_multiline var seed_prompt: String = ""

## Stores the conversation history. Each entry is a dictionary with details about the message.
## A potential chat history could look like this:
## [code]
## [
##   {"role": "user", "content": "How was your day ChatGPT?"}, 
##   {"role": "system", "content": "My day's been alright, how about yours?"}
## ]
## [/code]

# This function is called when a GPT request is completed.
# It processes the response from GPT and stores it in the history.

	# Call the base class's version of this function to ensure any base-level processing is carried out.
	super(gpt_response)
	# Append the GPT's response to the history with the role specified as "system".
	history.append({
		"role": "system",
		"content": gpt_response
	})

## Clears the conversation history.
func clear_history() -> void:
	history = []

## Initiates a chat request to GPT using the provided prompt.
## It structures the request based on the ongoing conversation history and sends it to ChatGPT.
